# Kerma : a crypto wallet #

This is a front end development project. Kerma is a decentralized crypto wallet. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS to build the simple responsive website. For now it is only a front end project but I plan on adding back end components as well to this project.

## What I learned ##

Using wireframe first was extremely helpful in building the website from scratch as I was able to make a template I could code around. I was able to learn more about bootstrap and how to put it to use to make a responsive website. I was able to brush up a bit on some JS and how to incorporate modals and Jquery. I plan on making this project using react in the near future as well so I can hopefully incorporate more JS into it as well as an API to retrieve Crypto Data. In this project I used widgets from Coin Market Cap
to retrieve Crypto data.
