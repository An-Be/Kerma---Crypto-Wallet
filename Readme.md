# Kerma : a crypto wallet

Kerma is a simple crypto wallet which I plan on making decentralized in the future. This is my first portfolio project, I will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS to build the simple responsive website. For now it is only going to be a website but in the future I wish to make an app which will provide the decentralized wallet functionality.

Currently a work in progress
